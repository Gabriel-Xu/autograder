        Rules<br>
      </strong>
      Do NOT submit malicious code with malicious intent to the grader. Furthermore, do not attempt to exploit any
      aspect of this system, including but not limited to, accessing unauthorized admin privileges, accessing private user
      information, etc. If we find out any misuse, you will be disqualified from participating in TJCT competitions,
      events, and also reported to our sponsors.<br>
      Furthermore, please follow all rules given when taking contests on this system. Perhaps there will be
      collaborative contests, but unless otherwise stated, contests are individual. All aspects of the TJHSST honor code
      apply.
      <br><br>
      <% if (!locals.tjioi) { %>
      In general, please note what you can and cannot do for contests. These are subject to change.
      <br>
      1. You ARE allowed to use templates and pre-written data structures. We acknowledge that in-houses are short on
      time and having pre-written code can make the process much less tedious.
      <br>
      2. You ARE allowed to use reference sources online such as language specific documentation. General algorithm guides such as GeeksForGeeks is allowed if the guide doesn't completely solve the problem.
      <br>
      3. You are NOT allowed consult intelligent/human sources during a contest.
      <br>
      4. You are NOT allowed to discuss problem details until the alloted time window for the contest is over.
